# Dockerizing
This repository contains a full development environment to be used to create/run a PHP (>= 7.0) project.

Most of the aspects of the configuration can be tuned via a `.env` file to be created in the [setup](docs/setup.md) phase.

As of now, this scaffolding can be used with all features on any *nix OS; full Windows support will be implemented in the near future.

## Contents
This configuration comprehends:

- Docker-sync support

- 2 web servers (`apache` and `nginx`)

- 2 DBMSs (`mysql`, `postgresql`)

- `redis` for cache management

- `minio` as storage layer (exposes a set of APIs compatible with Amazon S3)

- A `workspace` container: this is an extended `php` image with everything required to build and run a project, with cronjob and supervisor support
